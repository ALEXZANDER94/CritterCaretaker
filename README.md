# CritterCaretaker
The Critter Caretaker is a simple program that encapsulates a menu and a clear screen effect. 

Upon Running the program, you'll be prompted to name your Critter. 

Afterwards, the screen will be cleared and a menu will appear. The options are as follows: 
0 - Quit;
1 - Listen to your Critter;
2 - Feed your Critter;
3 - Play with your Critter;
4 - Diagnose your Critter

The "Quit" Option will print the message "Goodbye" to the screen and you are free to exit the program

The "Listen to your Critter" option will print the Critter's name and mood to the screen. The message will be available for 2 seconds before the screen clears

The "Feed your Critter" option will prompt you for input for how many pieces you would like to feed your pet. Afterwards, your pet will relay a message that is available for 2 seconds before the screen clears

The "Play with your Critter" option will prompt you for how many minutes you want to spend playing with your pet. Afterwards, your pet will relay a message that is available for 2 seconds before the screen clears

The "Diagnose your Critter" will calculate the mood of your pet in a slighly different fashion than the "Listen to your Critter" option, but, instead of printing out a mood, a message is relayed that tells you wether the Critter is more hungry than bored or vice versa

As you choose options from the menu, the Critter's hunger and boredom will increase and you'll be able to see that from the face that shows on each screen clear.
